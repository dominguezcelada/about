# about

Hi, I'm Gregor, ([@gr2m](https://github.com/gr2m/)), I maintain the JavaScript [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/) libraries for GitHub. I care safe and inclusive spaces in Open Source where communities can thrive.

In past discussions about renaming the "master" branch in git repositories, I saw three types of negative feedback

1. It's inconvenient
2. Itâ€™s not necessary, the "master" term comes from "mastering", not "master"/"slave"
3. Why do we have to make this political

My goal is to help with `1.` by creating an app to automate the process for GitHub repositories as much as possible.

In regard of `2.`, I want to mention two things.

1. Git was created as an alternative to the proprietary BitKeeper in 2005. BitKeeper used the master/slave terminology. And [Linus used the term in early communications](https://marc.info/?l=git&m=111968031816936&w=2) on the Git mailing list. So git's "master" branch origin is in fact coming from master/slave.
2. If you think the change is unnecessary, then it's not about you.

In regard of `3.`: Tech is not neutral, nor is it apolitical. I recommend listening to [#causeascene podcast](https://hashtagcauseascene.com/podcast/) which discusses the topic at length.

I also want to acknowledge that there are more important things to do in order to support the social justice movements, and we should not let GitHub and other companies deflect from the fact that they [continue to work with ICE](https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-06-12/github-ceo-black-lives-matter-employees-demand-end-ice-contract).

Changing the default branch from "master" to "main" is a change way overdue. Let's get it over with so we can focus on more important things. I created this website and app to help with these efforts.
